# Battleships

A single player recreation of the classic Battleship game!

## Goal:
The purpose of this project was to practice the Test Driven Development paradigm in order to develop code that is well-structured, maintainable, and testable by design (obviously)

## Features:
- "Smart" Bot that actively seeks and targets ships similar to a human player
- Interactive gameplay: chooseable ship placement and sound effects
- Responsive page layout

## Getting Started:
### Running the App
1. Clone the GitHub library
2. Install the neccessary dependencies via `npm i`
3. Build the project via `npm run build`
4. Host the webapp locally via `npm run dev`
### Running the Jest test suite
You can also manually run the test suite via `npm run test` or set up the test to automatically run on code changes via `npm run watch`

## Lessons Learned:
- TTD helps generate loosely coupled units of code!
- Good tests do not lock you in to an implementation
- TTD is an iterative design process: develop test, develop code, repeat

## What I Would Improve:
Better defining the scope of my classes and their methods. This is something that I am getting better at, but there is definitely still room for improvement.
